text printing graphical calculator for trigonometric functions (sine and cosine).


sine() and cosine() just return the x and y in the form of a list where output[0] is the x coordinate and output[1] is the y intercept

drawsine() and drawcosine() just draws a trig graph printed to the terminal

rangesine() and rangecosine() prints a long list of coordinates to the terminal, incrementing by 10 degrees, and it takes a range of values.
