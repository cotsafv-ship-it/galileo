text printing graphical calculator for trigonometric functions (sine and cosine)


proud to say i did this without chatgpt.


UPDATE 1: 11:44pm

i made the sine and cosine functions and made them output for a limit but i need specific values and not a range. the original code for the values is in ./cosine sine function for limit

the galileo file will be the graphing calculator
